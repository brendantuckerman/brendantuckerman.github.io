        I'm a web developer who aspires to make a difference through technology.  I'm energized by finding solutions to complex problems in creative ways and through an unceasing curiosity about learning new things.

        Iâ€™ve applied this curiosity to create code for Drupal projects with GovCMS SaaS platforms, as well as standard Drupal projects to better support the work of my clients.
